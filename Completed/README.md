# React Basics Lecture Project

This project is set up to demonstrate the basics of React, including component-based architecture, state management, props passing, event handling, and conditional rendering.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v12.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.x or later)

This project uses Vite as a build tool and React 17 or newer.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository and navigate into the project directory, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Codify-Berkeley-Education/Lecture-Code-React-Basics.git
cd your-project-directory
```


### Installing Dependencies

Once you are in the project directory, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the required libraries and packages needed for the project.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will compile the React application and open it in your default web browser.

### Navigating the Application

The application includes a simple navigation system that allows you to switch between different "pages":
- Home
- About Us
- Services
- Contact

These options demonstrate how React manages state and renders components conditionally based on user interaction.

## Additional Information

- **Component Structure**: This project breaks down the UI into reusable components, making it easier to manage and scale.
- **State Management**: State is managed locally within the `Website` component using React's `useState` hook.
- **Props**: Data is passed down to child components via props, demonstrating a typical parent-child communication in React.
- **Event Handling**: User interactions are handled using onClick event listeners, showcasing basic event handling in React.
- **Conditional Rendering**: The application conditionally renders components based on the current state, which is a fundamental concept in React for building dynamic user interfaces.

## Support

For additional help or further customization, consult the React documentation or contact the development team.

This README provides a complete guide to setting up and understanding the structure and functionality of your React application. Itâ€™s structured to be helpful for both experienced developers and those new to React or your project. Adjust the repository URL and any specific project details as necessary.
