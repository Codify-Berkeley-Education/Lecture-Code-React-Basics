    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>
        I am a student at the University of California, Berkeley, pursuing a degree in Applied Mathematics with a focus on data science applications. My academic and professional experiences reflect my passion for leveraging mathematical and computational tools to solve real-world problems.
        I’ve had the opportunity to intern at Amazon within the Amazon Prime organization, where I contributed to impactful projects enhancing customer experience. Additionally, I gained valuable experience at an educational technology startup, working at the intersection of innovation and learning. My research journey includes participating in a program at Carnegie Mellon University, where I developed a visualization program for the Cayley table of the mathematical group S₃, blending abstract algebra with intuitive design.
        Through my studies and experiences, I aim to bridge theoretical mathematics with practical solutions, continually learning and growing as a problem solver.
