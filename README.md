# **React Basics Lab - Build a Simple Website**  

### **📌 What This Lab Covers**  
This lab is about **building a basic website in React** using stuff we've already covered. By the end, you'll know how to:  

- **Break a website into components**  
- **Pass data with props**  
- **Use `useState` to manage state**  
- **Handle user clicks (events)**  
- **Switch between pages without React Router**  

---

### **🛠️ Setup**  
1️⃣ **Go to your project folder**  
```bash
cd lectureCodeReactBasics
```  
2️⃣ **If you don’t have a React app yet, create one. You should have one already.**  
```bash
npx create-react-app codifyeduweb
```  
3️⃣ **Open `codifyeduweb` should be under src directory**  
```
cd codifyeduweb
```  
4️⃣ **Run the app**  
```bash
npm start
```

### **📝 What You'll Build**  
A simple multi-page website with:  
✅ A **header**  
✅ A **navigation bar**  
✅ Pages for **Home, About, Services, and Contact**  
✅ **Clicking a button changes the page**  

---

### **🔧 Things to Try**  
- **Add a new page** and update navigation  
- **Style it** (even basic CSS is fine)  
- **Make a dark mode toggle** using state  

---

### **📌 For Instructors**  
- Keep it **hands-on**—let students modify things.  
- Ask **why we use props/state** instead of just showing it.  
- Encourage **small experiments** (changing components, adding interactivity).

### **🚀 Next Steps**  
If you finish early, check out **React Router** for real navigation.
